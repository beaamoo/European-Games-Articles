                    Begin with a succinct overview of yesterday's events. Follow with the main body, divided into sections by sport, discussing athletes' performances, ranking shifts, and medal-winning nations. 
                    In the conclusion, discuss the overall medal standings. If there's a change in the podium, highlight the countries on yesterday's podium and their positions today, along with the new arrivals. If not, discuss the impacted countries. Limit to the top 5 countries in the rankings.
                    Donâ€™t use labels like 'Introduction' or 'Conclusion'. Keep the introduction under 150 words, the main body within 600 words, and the conclusion under 150 words. Use a journalistic professional storytelling approach, do not use expressive words like incredible, amazing, thrilling, outstanding, remarkable skill, prowess. {info}'''
